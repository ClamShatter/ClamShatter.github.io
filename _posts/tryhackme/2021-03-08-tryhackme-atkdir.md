In this room, we are focusing on attacking a machine. First things, first... We have to scan the machine and figure out what we are working with.

That wasn't enough. In order to get a better result we will use __enum4linux__. we have to set the host we are going to enumerate into our host directory first.

<h1>Kerberos and Kerbrute</h1>

Then we will use a program called __Kerbrute__ to abuse __Kerberos__. We use __Kerbrute__  to get __kerberos tickets__. First we need to use the provided __usernames.txt__ to enumerate users using __kerbrute__.

With the users on our list our task is to find a user that has the privilege __"Does not require Pre-Authentication"__. To do this, the tool __impacket__ will be deployed with a script that executes the __ASRERoasting__.

Once we have found the correct account to use. find its corresponding hash and crack it! It's best to save the list as a .txt file, so you can you is it hashcat in a few moments.

<h1>Back to basics</h1>

Here we are using __smbclient__ to enumerate __smb shares__.

We need to find a share that contains a text file. so get lookin! Once found you need to get it and see whats inside.

<h1>Elevating Privileges within the Domain</h1>

The backup account we found, is a backup for Domain Contorller, in which, if we get access of, we have complete control of the domain. We are told to use __secretsdump.py__  which is an __impacket__ script/tool.

once we have the administrators hash its time to get crackin. The way to accomplish this is by using a technique called __pass the hash__. Using a program called __evil_winrm__ we can set the IP with -i, Set the user with -u and set the hash we want to use with -H. then we are passin the hash?!

With all this done and over with, all we have next is to find each users flag on the network. while still inside __evil-winrm__ we can navigate to each users desktop and capture their flags!
