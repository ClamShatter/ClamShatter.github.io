In this room, we are focusing on attacking a maachine. First things, first... We have to scan the machine and figure out what we are working with.

That wasn't enough. In order to get a better result we will use __enum4linux__. we have to set the host we are going to enumerate into our host directory first.

Then we will use a program called __Kerbrute__ to abuse __Kerberos__. We use __Kerbrute__  to get __kerberos tickets__. First we need to use the provided __usernames.txt__ to enumerate users using __kerbrute__.

With the users on our list our task is to find a user that has the privilege __"Does not require Pre-Authentication"__. To do this, the tool __impacket__ will be deployed with a script that executes the __ASRERoasting__.

Once we have found the correct account to use. find its corresponding hash and crack it! It's best to save the list as a .txt file, so you can you is it hashcat in a few moments.
