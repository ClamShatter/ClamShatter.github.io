This room is a bit different. We are actually looking at the website for vulnerabilities of all sorts. First we are asked to peruse the site and discover tidbits of information for later exploitability. Once we have looked through the site, we can start with the hacking. 

<h1>(Inject the Juice)</h1>

The focus here, is __SQL injection__. We'll be using a program called __Burp Suite__ to inject the malicious code. Set up __Burp Suite__ with a proxy program of your choice, on your preferred web browser. I chose __Firefox__ with __Foxyproxy__.
