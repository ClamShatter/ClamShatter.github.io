It's a nice change of pace in this room, which focuses on the more carnal aspect of security. There is 2 lectures that are very informative and entertaining. They provide a step by step walk through of basic lock picking and other security bypassing techniques. After taking as many notes as possible from both videos, its time to jump into the meat of things.

 We are prompted on the 3 different methods of physical pentesting. Overt, covert and surreptitious. Each one being more stealthy than the previous. Then we hit lock picking.

<h1>Lock Picking</h1>

This task asks us to display our new found knowledge of locking, by asking us a little bit about lock picking techniques and locks. There are numerous locks and each type has a different approach for how to pick it. The most common techniques are SSP or Single Pin Picking, which is fairly self explanatory and bump keys. Bump keys are specially made keys used in conjuction with a hammer (or similar) and a rubber band to force the pins into place. 

<h1>Lock Anatomy</h1>

Here, we are asked about the basic structure of locks and their use. From basic parts, like, keys and deadbolts to more obscure pieces, such as, the actuator. 

<h1>Padlock Bypassing</h1>

Padlocks are some of them most common types of locks to keep things secure. Basically, any type of housing or container can be padlocked for security reasons, but padlock vulnerabilities are well known amongst seasoned lock pickers and novices alike. Padlocks aren't just susceptible to bump keys and basic lock picks, but they also have other ways of entry. Any type of combination padlock is vulnerable to decoding and/or brute forcing. One of the bigger flaws of many padlocks, is the ability to bypass it with a shim.
